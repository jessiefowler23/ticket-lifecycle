Began by establishing a user ticket with one of the preset users. I had to make several problems for various users to apply for tickets.

The following step is to log into OsTicket as the default administrator. After doing so, click the ticket and change the priotity to the setting that best suits it. I'll then be able to designate an Agent to handle the ticket. I would then choose the proper SLA plan for the ticket after that. The appropriate departmentÂ for the ticket would then be selected. The agents will then be able to observe every little change that was made to the ticket as well as any responses that were made regarding the ticket.
