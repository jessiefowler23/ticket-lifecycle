Began by establishing a user ticket with one of the preset users. I had to make several problems for various users to apply for tickets.

The following step is to log into OsTicket as the default administrator. After doing so, click the ticket and change the priotity to the setting that best suits it. I'll then be able to designate an Agent to handle the ticket. I would then choose the proper SLA plan for the ticket after that. The appropriate departmentÂ for the ticket would then be selected. The agents will then be able to observe every little change that was made to the ticket as well as any responses that were made regarding the ticket.

<p>
Last but not least, I would log out of the administrator account and enter into the standard Agent account to view the ticket that was issued. I would then click the ticket that had been assigned to me to view any revisions made by the administrator, after which I might try to approach the situation differently and try to solve the issue for the client.
